# Removed Mods
- DoDMonsters, I'm removing this mod because I don't use every creature and to not have an excessive amount of bloat of creatures everywhere, feel free to still use this mod but all files related to this mod will be removed, keep the files if you wish to still use it.

- Recipes that used InfusedGemstones will be replaced with InfusedCrystal
