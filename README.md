# ValheimPlus does not work with this modpack

# What is RelicHeim?
- This modpack uses EpicLoot with EpicMMO and is balanced to make players not feel over powered, it comes with medium to hard difficulty based on player style.
  - All magiceffect values and set values have been nerfed
  - The magiceffects have been changed to be only applied on specific equipment and some you have to choose between one effect or the other 
    - Ex: `health regen or regen per tick`
  - Some magiceffects have been disabled due to being to overpowered or cause issues
  - EpicLoot in this modpack is drastically different compared to default, but feel free to ask questions in my discord
- EpicLoot: This modpack is designed around players enchanting their own gear so creatures will not be dropping massive amounts of loot, you will need to find Haldor to help with further enchanting.
- Only bosses and elite mobs aka trolls etc will have a chance at dropping enchanted loot, this loot is usually not the best and is better to sacrifice it to get materials in return to enchant yourself.
- More legendary sets and single legendary sets added to give a more different playstyle
- EpicMMO: Lets you play Valheim in a MMO playstyle where you need to level up your character in order to slay stronger enemies, you will do shit damage to a creature, boss if you're not at a high enough level, the name of creature will appear in red to tell you that you're not strong enough.


## Installing on Server
* This modpack uses "ThisGoesHere" to remove, move or clean up specific files.
* If you have issues on server being different then client, its probably due to not having this mod on your server
* Make sure content inside "Patchers" folder is also installed on your server.
* I would recommend making a clean profile, install JewelHeim, start game so all files are loaded, then copy **_plugins, patchers, configs_** to your server.
